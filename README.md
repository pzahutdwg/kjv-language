### Important notes
---
Variables must be defined with a word, like "let", "var", "const", etc.
---
Blocks are inside of curly braces. For example:
```js
if (condition) {
    doSomething()
}
```
---
Statements like "print" and "if" do not need parentheses, but functions do (for parameters).
---
'#' for comments
